OPENRETRODOCS

This is a open source website that goal is to safe guard documentation old and new for the future so we dont loose any, also to gather everything about retroconsoles on one site. Schematics, modding, specification, cables, EVERYTHING about retro consoles.

Since there are many consoles out there and i'm only one guy, i can't do everything i need help with this project, that where you come in. I need stuff for the site, like comparison betweek sync on luma and composite sync. What the best output method on each console. There are so much, so everything is appricated.

The site will focus in the near time heavly on Playstation and Xbox consoles and analog video technologies.
